Problem Statement: 
   Build a Front End Application that uses Unsplash API to retrieve images from it and display  12 of them to user based on what they searched for 
   
The requirements look like this: 
1. Get an Unsplash API Client Key by signing up for a free account (alternatively you can  use flickr or other image provider API) 
2. A user should be able to search for images by using a search box and a button 
3. If no image is found the APP should show no mage found 
4. If images are returned, then display their small dimension (links will be in the result returned)  
5. Each image being shown should also link to higher resolution version of the image itself 
6. When the image data is being loaded from the api you should show a loading indicator (e.g. spinner or text that says loading etc.) 
7. If there is an error in the API log it to the console 
8. Make sure to use routes, context and hook. 
9. Make sure to format data returned from the API in JSON if using fetch function to get data
